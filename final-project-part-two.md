# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

The more I thought about my outline in Part I, the more I realized that the story I'd like to tell is slightly different. I think a more compelling story would go as follows:
- **Setup:** (unchanged) The arts and culture sector is an important part of of our economy and overall daily lives.
- **Conflict:** Funding for the arts has been unstable and increasing at lower rate than the sector's growth rate.
- **Resolution:** The Arts Vibrancy Index can be a useful tool to understanding your local arts community and identify where to invest and what to advocate for.

I think I have a lot more data and narrative for this setup and conflict, and I think the resolution/call to action is a bit more clear. As interesting as I find the SMU DataArts data, I was having trouble converting it to a visualization because I don't have access to the full dataset, of which the rankings depend on.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

Given the setup that establishes the importance of the arts and culture sector, my target audience would not be people within the sector because that information is redundant. I do think that people just on the margins of the sector, however, could find this data useful. For example, local policy makers who are looking to connect with their community through strategic investments, or the general public who may be looking to increasing the arts activity of their community. As an indirect audience, arts organizations could even use the data and findings as part of their advocacy messages to people in and outside of their community.

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

My main goals with the interviews is to determine relevance to the reader, whether the story and graphs are easy to comprehend, and whether the resolution/call to action makes sense.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|    Narrative flow and comprehension   |       Did this narrative make sense to you? Was there anything that confused you?           |
|  Translation of intended audience    |         Who do you think is the intended audience for this? How do you see this data being used?         |
|  Relevance to audience    |       Did you feel compelled to learn more about this topic?           |
|   Clarity of resolution/call to action   |       What do you think the call to action is?           |
|   Comprehension of visualizations   |         Are the graphs easy to understand?         |
|   Value to audience   |        Did you learn anything new? If so, what?          |
|  Catching anything else that might sliip through    |        What questions do you still have?          |
