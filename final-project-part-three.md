# The final data story
I ended up creating a full version and a presentation version of my story with a few differences to better facilitate the 1-minute presentation.

**Presentation version:** [https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/arts-vibrancy-presentation/index.html#group-section-Econ-7Ih6BJkK0E](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/arts-vibrancy-presentation/index.html#group-section-Econ-7Ih6BJkK0E)

**Full story:**

The differences between the presentation version and the full version are for simplicity. For example, I preferred having a collage of images depicting different disciplines for my audience to look at rather than a block of text explaining art & culture with only one or two pictures.

# Changes made since Part II

I think many of the major changes are due to the expanded narrative capabilities of Shorthand as opposed to my hand-drawn outline. I did included a lengthy section on defining arts and culture, and I also weaved in some of the social/emotional impact of the industry to complement the economic impact. This was from feedback of interviewee #1, who would have preferred a more rounded decpition of impact rather than reducing the value of the arts & culture to just economic activity. I ended up having more to say about the set up than the conflict and resolution, but I thought it was fitting since I would rather emphasize the positive impact of the arts & culture regardless of the conflict. This change goes with that same interviewee's preference for a definition of arts vibrancy at the beginning of the story. I also wanted to push the community aspect of the story since I think that ties the impact together, and I appreciated knowing that this was new for two out of three interviewees who were not previously aware of the landscape of this industry.

I changed the pie charts displaying survey data about how people feel about the arts in the community to a pictogram because I thought the icons of the people would be more impactful, and I did not want readers to get distracted by the other areas of the pie chart (neutral, disgaree, and strongly disagree), especially when the overwhelming majority of respnses were "agree" and "strongly agree".

I changed the color scheme slightly but kept with vibrant colors aligned with my intention to begin and end the presentation on a positive note. The arts & culture are generally coded as orange, with other accent colors of purple, green, 

I was rather impressed with the intuitive nature of Shorthand and the range of possibilities I was able to explore to make an engaging story.


## The audience

As stated in part II, my initial primary audience were people outside of the arts & culture sector, particularly policymakers who could be searching for new ways to connect with their community. Other personas in my audience also included members of the general public who were interested in getting more involved with their community, as well as arts organizations looking for ways to expand their advocacy message.

My audience in part III has shifted focus, but the three personas remain the same. This final version of the story is aimed more towards aimed more towards the average person, but still with the intent to influence public policy and potentially to be used by arts organizations in their own advocacy campaigns. Part of what influenced this shift was the call to action. Part of the call to action is to reach out to local policy and decision makers, so it made more sense to center the story around the public rather than the policymakers themselves. I wanted this particular call to action because I thought it gave the story a better focus (as opposed to just leading the readers to the SMU DataArts map and AFTA resources). As mentioned in part II, I tried my best to avoid or at the very least explain industry-jargon/concepts and to frame the impact from various angles in attempts to appeal to the different ways people interpret impact.
