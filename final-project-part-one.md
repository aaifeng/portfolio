# Outline
Given my interest in the arts and culture sector, I'd like to present data around the SMU DataArts Arts Vibrancy Index and the visible trends among the top 40 communities.

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
SMU DataArts publishes a full report and interactive map each year for the Arts Vibrancy Index of participating communities. I would be using the data for the top 40 communities, which includes the community (city and state), ranking, region, population, and cost of living index. They also provide additional data about how the ranking and arts vibrancy was calculated by summing three major categories: arts providers, arts dollars, and public support.

The report regarding Local Arts Agencies' effect on Arts Vibrancy is not a one-to-one comparison of the top 40 communtiies, but I think I would be able to highlight some correlating points with this data to supplement.

While I recognize that SMU DataArts already has robust information around arts vibrancy, I think that the presentation of the data is fairly straightforward and neutral as they are the sector's main data resource. I'd like to take the opportunity to draw more conclusions across their studies.

# Method and medium
The best medium, in my opinion, for this project would be to build a story in Shorthand. Shorthand seems to be the most intuitive platforom for immersive storytelling with plenty of guides without sacrificiing customization. I also appreciate that Shorthand allows users to incorporate several visually engaging tools, given that my audience may not know or be well informed about the data that I am presenting.
