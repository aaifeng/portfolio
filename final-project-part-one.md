# Outline
Given my interest in the arts and culture sector, I'd like to present data around the SMU DataArts Arts Vibrancy Index and the visible trends among the top 40 communities.

**Setup:** The arts and culture sector is an important part of of our economy and overall daily lives.

**Conflict:** It's unclear why some communities have thriving arts and what can be done to uplift the arts in your own community.
**Resolution:** Understanding the artistic vibrancy of your own community will help you know where to invest and what to advocate for.

Restated in a different way...

**One-Sentence Summary:** The arts and culture sector can be measured in data, and that data can tell you a lot about policy and economic structure of a community.
**What should your audience/reader understand after reading your story?:** Understanding arts vibrancy can be the starting point for framing advocacy and driving policy to increase access and funding to your local arts community.
**Call-to-Action:** Be informed about how you support your local community for the most effective impact on the arts.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
SMU DataArts publishes a full report and interactive map each year for the Arts Vibrancy Index of participating communities. I would be using the data for the top 40 communities, which includes the community (city and state), ranking, region, population, and cost of living index. They also provide additional data about how the ranking and arts vibrancy was calculated by summing three major categories: arts providers, arts dollars, and public support.

The report regarding Local Arts Agencies' effect on Arts Vibrancy is not a one-to-one comparison of the top 40 communtiies, but I think I would be able to highlight some correlating points with this data to supplement.

The AEP6 Report will help with the setup of the storyboard to frame how the arts are an economic driver and important to communities.

While I recognize that SMU DataArts and AFTA already has robust information around arts vibrancy, I think that the presentation of the data is fairly straightforward and neutral as they are the sector's main data resource. I'd like to take the opportunity to draw more conclusions across their studies.

# Method and medium
The best medium, in my opinion, for this project would be to build a story in Shorthand. Shorthand seems to be the most intuitive platforom for immersive storytelling with plenty of guides without sacrificiing customization. I also appreciate that Shorthand allows users to incorporate several visually engaging tools, given that my audience may not know or be well informed about the data that I am presenting.
