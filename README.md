# Portfolio
Public portfolio for 94-870 Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University. 

# About me
Hello! My name is Ana-Alicia Feng (she/her), and I am a Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. I received a B.A. in Studio Art with a concentration in painting, a B.S. in Marketing, and a minor in Art History from the University of Maryland, College Park. Before coming to CMU, I worked for five years as the Grants Assistant Manager at a public grantmaking agency for local arts and humanities non-profits and individual artists and scholars in Montgomery County, Maryland.

I fell into arts management after realizing that I was less interested in creating the art than I was in finding ways to share and increase access to the art. Survey analysis experiences from past internships and the advocacy work inherent to public grantmaking really opened my eyes to the possibilities of data-driven decisions and how data is digested differently depending on its presentation.

I'm interested in exploring how data can be used to strengthen the relationship between arts organizations and their communities.

# What I hope to learn
My overall goal is to build a foundation in data visualization. Within that, I want to...

- learn how to identify which visualization types are better suited depending on my audience
- have a better understanding of overall best practices as they relates to type, color, and scale
- start developing skills in Tableau
