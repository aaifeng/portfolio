# Visualizing Government Debt

As shown by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) data, debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. This value is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance, and changes in government debt over time tends to reflect the impact of past government deficits. All three graphs below present similar data but in visually distinct ways.

The graph generated by OECD's website gives a good general snapshot of government debt in 2020 with a small interactive component, allowing viewers to mouse over the columns and gather more specific data, like the debt percent of GDP of a country. The gray columns allow for potential highlights if needed, and also facilitates the interactive feature with greater contrast. The gray background seems unnecessary and that added color feels distracting. Likewise, the serif font of the title feels like it is part of a different text rather than the title of the graph. The vertical bar chart makes the countries easily sortable and identifiable to the viewer. However, this graph is simplified in part because it is limited to one year, whereas the two Tableau graphs incorporate several years.

The heat map visualization created with Tableau allows for the debt percent of GDP per country to be displayed directly on the map without having to use the mouse-over feature, though it exists in this map as well. Tableau's graphs have interesting interactive components in which the viewers themselves can sort the columns and rows from limited selections. While the heat map is effective and I agree with the orange-to-blue color scaling to represent most in debt to least, the downside of this heat map is that the year-to-year comparison is not immediately clear, as viewers have to scroll to the right and down to fully capture the data set.

I chose to do a line graph because I was interested in seeing how each country's debt changes over time. I liked that the line graph was able to capture the full data set in a more concise way than the heat map. Unfortunately, the country labels in this graph made it too cluttered, so I instead chose to highlight two countries so that the graph's content is more focused. Because the two countries are named in the title and the difference in their data is so stark, I refrained from using labels on the graph itself, though labels for those two lines (Japan being the blue line and the U.S. being the red line) would not be unwelcome either. I reduced the tick marks on both axis so that the data is more digestible. This Tableau graph also has a helpful mouse-over feature to capture more specific data. I also appreciated the fitlering features on the righthand side that allow viewers to highlight specific countries while still being able to compare that country to Japan and the U.S., which continue to standout even in the background.

The OECD website graph to me is the clearest, however given the fact that the two Tableau graphs are incorporating multiple years, I process the line graph faster than I do the heat map. The title and color highlights of the line graph also help me focus faster on specific data points, whereas I need to take in more information and create my own narrative with the heat map. If I were to change something about the line graph, I would add in labels for Japan and the U.S. for added clarity. Unexplored in this graph, but I also think there's an interesting narrative for countries that have had debt-to-GDP ratios above 100% over the years.
